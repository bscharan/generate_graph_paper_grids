HELLO UNIVERSE


This is a python script to create graph_sheets of any size. 
(I can't remember the exact word but it is same as cartesian grids we used in highschool math plotting)
refer images above.

I am developer and use these images as backgroud reference for my designs (i.e., to figure out padding, etc on go)

hope this will help.



TODO:
rather than increasing the width, make lines bold. I will make sure it will use dotted lines in near future.
